C-Language Function Library for Atmel AVR Processors


- AVRlib is a library of easy-to-use C functions for a variety of common and uncommon tasks using AVR processors.
- The goal of AVRlib is to allow programmers to work quickly towards their end goal by reducing the time needed to write basic support functions and code.
- Most AVRlib header (*.h) files have lengthy descriptions of how to use the supplied library functions. All code (*.c) files are heavily commented with additional information.
- Documentation is still being improved and refined on many libraries. When getting familiar with a library, look first at the HTML docs and any example code that is available in the examples directory. Then look inside the *.h and *conf.h files, and then the *.c file for that library for more details and documentation.
- Significant example code is included in avrlib.zip. The example code is heavily commented and strives to illustrate how to use various AVRlib function libraries.
